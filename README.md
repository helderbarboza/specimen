# Specimen

A better (sane) default factory implementation  

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `specimen` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:specimen, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/specimen](https://hexdocs.pm/specimen).

## Basic Usage

Define a factory file with configuration and optional states:

```elixir
defmodule UserFactory do
  use Specimen.Factory, module: User

  def build(specimen) do
    Specimen.include(specimen, :name, "John")
  end

  def state(:surname, %User{} = user) do
    Map.put(user, :surname, "Doe")
  end

  def after_making(%User{} = user) do
    Map.put(user, :age, 42)
  end  
end
```

And then:

```elixir
# Make just one user
{%User{}, _context} = UserFactory.make_one()

# Make the specified amount of users
{users, _contexts} = UserFactory.make_many(10)

# Make users by including specific states
{%User{surname: "Doe"}, _context} = UserFactory.make_one([:surname])
```

Call it directly from your struct/ schema modules:

```elixir
defmodule User do
  use Specimen.HasFactory, UserFactory
  defstruct [:name, :surname, :age]
end
```

```elixir
{user, _} = User.Factory.make_one()
{users, _} = User.Factory.make_many(10)
```

## TODO List

- [x] Expose `create_one` and `create_many` implementations on factories
- [ ] Add support for more Ecto types (UUID, embeds, etc...)
- [ ] Allow configuration of Repo globally through application settings
- [x] Allow configuration of Repo for each factory individually
- [ ] Allow extension of custom types through external implementations (specific domains)
- [ ] See if we can enforce that a non-empty factory only builds items for the specified module
- [ ] Take in consideration excluded and included fields before using `Specimen.fill/1`
- [ ] Allow the configuration of default states to call per factory
- [x] Allow passing attributes / context through function calls (use-case: override default factory definitions)
- [x] Return creation context along with created items (use-case: access values created by inner factory definitions)
- [ ] Add support to sequences (sequencing values)
- [x] Add support to vary from a given list of values (use-case: generate distinct values from a given list, eg: user roles)
- [ ] Rename `create_many` to `create_all` for performance usages and make `create_many` rely on `create_one` the same way `make_many` relies on `make_one`
  - [ ] Allow user to pass a function to patch structs into entries so `create_all` can use `Repo.insert_all` properly (right now we just remove some fields and hope everything works, but each user might have a different need).
- [ ] Check if grouping individual contexts by state can facilitate the return (eg: [state_context_1: %{}, state_context_2: %{}]).
This would allow us to use multiple contexts that return similar states (keys) without mixing/ merging the result into a single map.
- [ ] Add `:override` option that allows the user to replace fields dynamically without having to hardcode optional code inside `after_making` and `after_creating`
